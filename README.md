# github-clone

### What is it?
Github Clone is just as the name states, a Github clone of sorts. Github Clone allows users to search for Github profiles and
if successful, directs them to a profile page that lists the user's repos, stargazers, followers, following, etc. User's can
select a repo listed on the profile and then are redirected to a page which contains information regarding that repo such as:
languages used, date created, date of last update, stargazers, forks, watchers, etc.

### What's different?
While Github Clone allows users to search for profiles and view repo details, there are also many other applications that accomplish that same thing. So what Github Clone does differently is it also allows users to **compare** profiles using what I called the
**Comparator**. Comparator will look at both users' overall profile stats and performs a comparison of the two. Upon completeion
of comparing, Comparator will declare a winner. While in most cases there is a winner, ties are entirely possible and have been
accounted for.
